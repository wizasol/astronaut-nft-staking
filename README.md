- Program account types are declared here: `/cli/types.ts`
- Idl to make the JS binding easy is here: `/cli/staking_program.json`

Able to test the script functions working in this way.

## Features

### As a Smart Contract Owner
For the first time use, the Smart Contract Owner should `initialize` the Smart Contract for global account allocation.
- `initProject`
 
Recall `initialize` function for update the Threshold values after change the constants properly
- `initProject` 

Maintain the Reward token($COSMIC) vault's balance
- `REWARD_TOKEN_MINT` is the reward token mint (for test).
- `rewardVault` is the reward token account for owner. The owner should have the token's `Mint Authority` or should `Fund` regularly.

- According to the rank of NFTs, there reward amount will be changed automatically following the below logic.
```

Trait based 
Adventurer: 20 $coin a day 
Scientist: 25 $coin a day 
Doctor: 30 coin a day 
Mission Specialist: 35 $coin a day 
Commander: 40 $coin a day
If you claim before 15 days, you will receive 75% and after 15 days, will receive 100%.

Model 2 
Rewards are paid daily and they are the same for all NFTS, so x $coin a day for everything 

Model 3 
7 days x $coin 
14 days 1.5x $coin 
30 days+ 2x $coin
```
